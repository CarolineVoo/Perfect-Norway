                            Norway is a country located in Northern Europe on the northern and western parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula, 
                            bordering the North Sea in the southwest, the Skagerrak inlet to the south, the North Atlantic Ocean in the west, 
                            and the Barents Sea in the northeast. Norway has a long land border with Sweden to the east, a shorter one with Finland 
                            in the northeast and a still shorter border with Russia in the far northeast.

                        Mountains are an integral part of what makes Norway, Norway. The Land of the Vikings is home to some of the highest mountain 
                        peaks in Europe with nearly 300 of them rising above 2,000 metres. The real reason to ski or snowboard in the high mountains  
                        is for the once in a lifetime experiences. It's normal for norwegian people to have cabins on the mountain so they can take their families for holidays.
                        Norway will give one the chance a breathtaking views with a beautiful natures, when people are hiking.
                        This country may be famous for its fjords (and rightly so), but its waterfalls are hardly lacking in magnificence. 
                        Exceeding over 300 in number with many being among the tallest in the world, Norwegian waterfalls are a sight to 
                        behold as they cascade from the mountains.
